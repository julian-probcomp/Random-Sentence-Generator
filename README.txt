About the Random Sentence Generator
-----------------------------------
This random sentence generator features an interactive website to generate random sentences using the Markov model and probability based transitions, an extension of finite automaton in which the next state is chosen by randomly selecting one of many possible states. Different training models can be used to generate the sentences from, and the Markov Model can be adjusted to alter the quality and "authenticity" of the generated sentences.


How to use the Random Sentence Generator
----------------------------------------
- Select the markov order from the dropdown (a higher markov order produces sentences that are increasingly grammatically correct)
- Specify the number of characters that should be generated by the random sentence generator
- Paste starter text into the large text field. The more text pasted here, the better quality the sentences that are produced.
  A starter text file is included that can be used to paste as the starter text for the sentence generator (it is a very large text file - copying and pasting a few dozen lines would be sufficient, but the more that is pasted in, the more interesting and cohesive the output of the random generator becomes)
- Click the "Generate Sentences" button and view the resulting generated sentences
