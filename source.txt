I set out alone, finding no companion to cheer the way with friendly intercourse, and no party of travellers with whom to associate myself. Swayed by an overmastering impulse within me, and a long-cherished desire to visit those glorious sanctuaries, I resolved to quit all my friends and tear myself away from my home. As my parents were still alive, it weighed grievously upon me to part from them, and both they and I were afflicted with sorrow.

The population of the city came out to meet the members of our party, and on all sides greetings and question were exchanged, but not a soul greeted me as no one there was known to me. I was so affected by my loneliness that I could not restrain my tears and wept bitterly, until one of the pilgrims realized the cause of my distress and coming up to me greeted me kindly and continued to entertain me with friendly talk until I entered the city.

I'm very concerned. My sink was installed a little over two years ago and I'm beginning to see hair line cracks appear. At first I thought it was a stain but I looked underneath and it’s fracturing. I’ve loved it up until now. Love the way it looks. I’m going to have a real problem if I have to replace it. I’ve tried to show in the photo the damage but it’s not easy to see. As I said these are hairline fractures. Certainly it has sustained no damage from us.

There is nothing to say except that these bizarre floor mats are a better mood elevator than all the serotonin re-uptake drugs ever invented. If you have dogs they will thank you for buying one or more of these. If you have feet they too will thank you for bringing one of these heater mats into your life. Pros: No thinking involved to employ--plug in the cord. Greater pleasure in being will come from standing (or lying!) in the field of toastiness. Put one next to your bed, place slippers atop, wake to joyous foot warmth. Love humanity--even if briefly--as a result. At least love the memory of Tesla, if no one else. Cons: You have to be neat--no piling laundry on top! Yes, I should be neat anyhow...sue me. Not a hard duty item--playing dogs chasing tennis balls is a bad idea if heater mat is not generously within the perimeter of the area rug. It will still work, but it will become frowzy and wrinkled. Cord is large, as is appropriate for the needs, but can be difficult to camouflage. I would buy these over again every day of the week. Mine are at least five years old, are put to use every winter, and are in three rooms of my six room house. These odd heater mats bring a comfort to my life which is sorely lacking, here in the land of the palmetto bug and eight solid summertime months of soul-sapping AC. They will come with me when I move north, and I will continue to treasure them.

Is what it says it is. Looks cute. Only thing is it needs something additional to make it stick well.

It's all about measuring everything and piecing it together.

This is an amazing product! It looks like tile but it’s not! I have gotten many compliments on it, and when I tell them it’s peel and stick, they don’t believe me. It was very easy to use and cut so that the pieces fit together. I would highly recommend.

Looks foolish! So fake and looks cheesy, the pattern is tiny and the black spacing looks nothing like grout. Sad I missed the return window.

Makes my door look happy and welcoming!

It’s just absolutely adorable. Every single person who has walked up to the door has commented on it! It’s different and FUN! The quality of the material is fantastic. It’s actually pretty heavy and seems to be a well made product.
